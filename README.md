# Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock Price Forecasting
This project demonstrates a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast stock prices using historical data. The app allows users to select from different asset categories and simulate future stock price paths. It provides forecasts, visualizations, and calculates Value at Risk (VaR).

## Features
* Asset Selection: Choose from different asset categories like currencies, cryptocurrencies, stocks, and indexes.
* Monte Carlo Simulation: Run multiple simulations to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
* Forecast Visualization: See both the historical price data and simulated future price paths.
* Risk Analysis (VaR): Calculates Value at Risk (VaR) at 95% and 99% confidence levels.
## How It Works
-Select Asset Category and Asset: Choose from asset categories such as CURRENCIES, CRYPTO, B3_STOCKS, SP500, NASDAQ100, and Indexes.
-Monte Carlo Simulation: The app calculates future stock prices based on historical data using daily returns, drift, and volatility. It performs multiple simulations to predict different future price paths.
-Risk Metrics: The final forecasted prices are analyzed to calculate the average price, as well as VaR for 95% and 99% confidence levels.
-Visual Output: The app displays a graph of historical stock prices and simulated future prices, along with the final price distribution and risk analysis.
